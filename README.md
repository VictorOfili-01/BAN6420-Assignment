This file consists of two programmes I developed (in Python and R) to facilitate the weekly payments of workers.
I created a list of 400 workers dynamically.
I also uUtilized a for loop to generate payment slips for each of the 400 workers.
Finally, I implemented conditional statements within the for loop to assign grades to each worker along with their respective salaries in a dynamic fashion.
